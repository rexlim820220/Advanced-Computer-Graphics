Textbooks/References:
1. Physically Based Rendering, by Matt Pharr and Greg Humphreys. (The eBook of the 2nd
Edition is available at the NTNU Library.)
2. Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, 3
rd Ed., by Hughes et al.

Grading: Progamming Assignments: 30%, Paper Study & Reports: 30%, Final Project: 30%,
Class Participation: 10%
Workload (subject to change):
1. Programming Assignments: There will be two or three parts to build a simple
distributed ray tracer. Don’t worry about its complexity. Examples or pseudo codes are
available to make them easier and enjoyable to you.
2. Paper Study & Reports: During the second half of the course, we will adopt a flipped
classroom approach. Reading will be assigned before each class meeting and a report will
be due in class to foster the discussion. Each class will be concluded with the teacher’s
summary.
3. Project: The class will be divided into teams of 1-2 persons, with each team working on a
different project. At the 10th week, each team should finish the proposal. At the 14
th
week, each team will present the current progress. Before the end of semester, each
team will present its results and demonstrate the finished product.
Topics and Schedule (subject to change):
 Overview and Introduction (1 week)
 OpenGL and graphics pipeline (1 weeks)
 Ray Tracing and Reflection Models (2 weeks)
 Spatial Partitions and Acceleration Structures (2 weeks)
 Radiosity (1 week)
 Environment Lighting and Indirect Lighting (2 weeks)
 Monte Carlo Path Tracing (3 weeks)
 Real-Time Global Illumination (2 week)
 Project Proposal and Demos (2-3 weeks)
